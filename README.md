## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
### Architecture  
- **RESTful API Hosting:** Some APIs are deployed on Cloudflare for enhanced scalability.  
- **Conductor Workflow:**  
  - Manages OAuth 2.0 token renewal and interactions with Firebase Cloud Messaging.  
  - Handles complex workflows like regenerating expired tokens and scheduling notifications.

**Key Workflows:**  
- **Renew OAuth 2.0 Token:**  
  - If tokens are valid: [Check token status](https://play.orkes.io/execution/042992d2-8e9f-11ef-85a8-ba73d777fd9d)  
  - If expired: [Renew tokens](https://play.orkes.io/execution/3d67949b-8e9b-11ef-b6be-323517a1f1a2)  
- **Send Push Notifications:**  
  - Collect mobile users' access tokens via a `GET` request.  
  - Validate or renew tokens if expired.  
  - Send notifications through a `POST` request to Firebase's HTTP v1 API.
